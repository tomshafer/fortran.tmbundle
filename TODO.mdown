# To-Do

## Language Grammars
- Branch new language grammar into F77 (with e.g. dabs()/cabs()) and F90 parts as before
- Fix hacky way of scoping ends of program units. I.e. move from `entity.name.function.module.end`.

## Preferences
- More selective code folding
- Is there a good way to exclude folding on one liners such as the following?
        program [program_name]; [ etc. ]; end program
